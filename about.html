                <p>Hi! I'm William, and <br>I'm a Software Engineer studying Computer Science at UC Berkeley. </p>
            </div>
            <div class="portfolio">
                <p>I started my freshman year at Cal as an undeclared major in the college of Letters and Science.  My interests are diverse and I explored several majors including Data Science, Economics and Computer Science.  <br>
                    As a rising college freshman, I interned with Gallagher which is a large insurance broker. There I worked with their finance team to forecast revenue for our producers, met with clients to learn about their businesses and how we interface with them, and also led a 30 minute presentation on a tool I built for the real estate team to automatically categorize different claims in excel.  This was a great experience as it gave me exposure to a very large company with a traditional internship structure. <br>
                    As a rising sophomore, I interned for the Batchery.  This was an amazing experience as it gave me real exposure to the startup world on multiple fronts including financing, fundraising and technology.  This evolved from a summer internship to a job that I handled until fairly recently.  <br>
                    Ultimately, I declared as a Computer Science major, because I found a true passion for technology.  I am developing technical expertise from working on several technical projects in Java, Python, and C. I am also currently enrolled in a full-stack development course where I will be building websites throughout the semester and develop skills in React, REST, Node.js, MongoDB, Django, and PostgreSQL. This course will conclude by collaborating with a team of four to build a fully developed website.  This technical knowledge coupled with my business, economics and data science background will allow me to bring a broad breadth of skills to a startup company that will allow me to help with many aspects of a project.
